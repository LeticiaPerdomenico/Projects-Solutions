1. Open https://github.com/Codecademy/practice-rebase-off-platform-project
2. Click on fork, and fork again.
3. Click on code, click on the copy symbol next to the http... address
4. Go to a shell on your computer and write the command: git clone and paste the address you've coppied (ctrl + v).
5. Then write ls, to list all the files on your location.
6. Change to the directory you have cloned with cd practice-rebase-off-platform-project
7. With ls again we see all the files and directories inside the folder.
8. Use git branch to check which branches you have cloned to your computer.
9. We only have main, but since we know we have two more branches, we must clone them too. With 
   git checkout part_1_Monday
   git pull
   git checkout part_2_Monday
   git pull
10. Check all commits with git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all
11. To cechk first branch we write git checkout part_1_Monday
12. And we rebase this first branch with main with git rebase main
13. Finally we check the new state of the branches with git log --graph --decorate --online --all
