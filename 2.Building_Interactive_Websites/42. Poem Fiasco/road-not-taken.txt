I Took All the Roads, by Robert Forks

Two roads went exactly the same way
And I was happy to travel them both
And be one traveler, I figured it out quick
blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah

blah blah blah blah
Both had terrible claims
Because it was smooth and boring
blah blah blah blah
This poem is terrible, Rob.

blah blah blah blah
In leaves no step had trodden blah
Oh, blah blah blah BLAAAAHHH
WEEEEEEEE!! This road is awesome.
I'm definitely coming back here!

Hahahahahahahhaha
Two roads diverged in a hahahahaha
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH! Gotcha.

HERE COMES MY DRASTICK CHANGE I AM NOT HAPPY WITH FIRE AND ICE SO YOU SHOULD HAVEN'T READ IT!
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel beoth
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
/*9*/
HERE COMES MY DRASTICK CHANGE I AM NOT HAPPY WITH FIRE AND ICE SO YOU SHOULD HAVEN'T READ IT!
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

HERE COMES MY DRASTICK CHANGE I AM NOT HAPPY WITH FIRE AND ICE SO YOU SHOULD HAVEN'T READ IT!
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

HERE COMES MY DRASTICK CHANGE I AM NOT HAPPY WITH FIRE AND ICE SO YOU SHOULD HAVEN'T READ IT!
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,

/*2*/
And that has made all the difference.
