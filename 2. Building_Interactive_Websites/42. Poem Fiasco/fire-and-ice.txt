Fire and Ice, by Robert Frost
/*9*/
HERE COMES MY DRASTICK CHANGE I AM NOT HAPPY WITH FIRE AND ICE SO YOU SHOULD HAVEN'T READ IT!
Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice

/*5*/
Is also okay
And would suffice.
