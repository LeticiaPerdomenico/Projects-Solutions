HERE COMES MY DRASTICK CHANGE I AM NOT HAPPY WITH FIRE AND ICE SO YOU SHOULD HAVEN'T READ IT!
The Annoying Bird, by Robyn Lost

There is a terrible singer nobody wants to hear,
Loud, a mid-summer waker-upper bird,
Who makes aweful noise all day and night,
Like BAAAAAAAAH! And QUACK!
He says things that make no sense
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BAAAAAH QUACK
On sunny days a moment's CHIRP;
Ruining your poem ruining your poem ruining it, yeah!
This one will never ever ever ever be published, nope!
The bird would CHIRP CHIRP BAAAK!

HERE COMES MY DRASTICK CHANGE I AM NOT HAPPY WITH FIRE AND ICE SO YOU SHOULD HAVEN'T READ IT!

There is a singer everyone has heard,
Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,
Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again.
He says that leaves are old and that for flowers
Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten.
He says the early petal-fall is past
When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers
On sunny days a moment overcast;
And comes that other fall we name the fall.
He says the highway dust is over all.
The bird would cease and be as other birds
But that he knows in singing not to sing.
The question that he frames in all but words

/*4*/
Is what to make of a diminished thing.
